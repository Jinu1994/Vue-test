Question 1: 

 I need to display the follwing data in this page:
            i) Original price 
            ii) Discount
            iii) Sale price

* i and ii are given or initialized when the page loads.
* iii is calculated as : Sale price = (Original price) - discount

Update the component Question1.vue to render the above data using string interpolation



Question 2: 

Question2.vue is the  parent component with the data property 'rating', initialized to 1.
Component 'Child1.vue' is rendered within this component and the 'rating' property is passed into the child component.
The child component displays both the parent rating and its own rating. The child component has a button to increase the child rating.
How would you increase the parent's 'rating' whenever the child's rating is increased ?



Question 4: 

Question4.vue is the parent component. Component 'Child2.vue' is rendered with this component.
Child2.vue has two containers , one for header and one for body. Assume you want to render a header tag <h1> in the header and a paragraph <p> in the body with some random message in it.
How would you pass the contents from the parent component Question4.vue?


Question 5: 

Question5.vue is a simple component displaying the text 'Change my attributes'. It has two properties isError and isBold.
There are three buttons , one to set isError = true, one to set isBold = true and one to set both to false.

I want to change the color of the displayed text to 'red' when 'isError' is true,  make the text bold  when 'isBold' is true
and revert back to the original text when reset is clicked.

How would you achieve this?


Question 6: 

Question6.vue is a component with two containers elements. The component data is an array of students with 'id' and 'name'. 
I want to display the names of the students whose ids are multiples of 2 in container 1 and whose ids are multiples of 3 in container 2.
How would you achieve this?


Question 7: 

I want to collect some information from the user by rendering a form. The form should have the following fields:
1) Full name (text input)
2) Age (text input)
3) Gender (radio buttons)
4) Programming languages (check boxes with 3 options. i) Vuejs ii) C# iii) Angular )

There should be a submit button at the end, on clicking it display the collected details below

Question 8:

Assuming you have created the form in question 7. I want to collect additional information if the user's age is above 22 and he likes the programming language 'Vue js'.
So if the above conditions are met, then add one  more element in the form : 
1) Experience - A select dropdown with the options : (1 year, 2 years , 3 years and  4 years and above)


Question 9: 

Assuming you have created the form in quesiont 7. On clicking submit , I want to navigate the user to a different page and display his name , age and his favourite programming languages

Add a new page to display his details and add the logic to redirect the user to the new page on submit.
